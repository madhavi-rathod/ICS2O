Instructions for Hangman
</h1>

<p align="center">
Hangman is a very simple childhood game. For this version you need to first press the go button in order for me to generate the name of a random country. This will be 
the word you are trying to guess. Once the word is chosen, you will need to start guessing letters. If the letter you guess is in the word you will be safe, however if the letter
is not in the word, you will lose a life. You have a total of 5 lives, winning the game means that you have guessed the word before your lives run out and losing the game means 
that you were unable to guess the word. Now that you know how to play, time to start the game!
